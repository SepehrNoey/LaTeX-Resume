\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}
    \begin{rSubsection}{AI-Medic Co. , Tehran, Iran}{Jun. 2022 - Sep. 2022}{Artificial Intelligence Intern}{}
     \item Interns at this position participated in some entry-level courses for learning ML and DL and 
     they were also asked to implement some of these methods to achieve better predictions and solutions 
     for medical purposes.
     \item In each project, Interns were required to implement an ML/DL method process to achieve the goal. This 
     include doing some tasks on datasets like preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, validation and prediction. 
     Scikit-Learn was the main library used in these projects.
